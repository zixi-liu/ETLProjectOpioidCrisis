## What is the scope of prescription drug misuse

Misuse of prescription opioids, CNS depressants, and stimulants is a serious public health problem in the United States. According to NIH studies, the reasons for the high prevalence of [prescription drug misuse](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/misuse-prescription-drugs/what-scope-prescription-drug-misuse) vary by age, gender, and other factors, but likely include ease of access. The number of prescriptions for some of these medications has increased dramatically since the early 1990s. Moreover, misinformation about the addictive properties of prescription opioids and the perception that prescription drugs are less harmful than illicit drugs are other possible contributors to the problem. Although misuse of prescription drugs affects many Americans, certain populations such as youth and older adults may be at particular risk.
